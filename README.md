# Air Quality Analysis for Air Pure Innovations

## Project Overview:
-**This project focuses on air quality analysis with the primary goal of generating actionable insights to support the design and development of efficient air purifiers for Air Pure Innovations.
The air we breathe directly impacts human health, and with rising concerns over pollution, understanding the factors influencing air quality has become crucial.
By performing a deep dive into publicly available air quality datasets, this project addresses several critical questions that need to be answered before moving ahead with air purifier development.

## Objective:
-**Severity Mapping: Identify cities experiencing persistent or worsening AQI (Air Quality Index) levels.
Health Impact Correlation: Quantify the health burden due to pollution and its impact on consumers' well-being.
Demand Triggers: Examine the relationship between pollution spikes and shifts in consumer behavior related to air purifier demand.

## Seasonal Trends:
-**The project also explores seasonal patterns in AQI:
Winter months show worsened air quality due to temperature inversions, industrial activity, and heating-related emissions.
Monsoon and early summer generally improve air quality, but ozone can spike during hot months.
These patterns help predict when and where air purifiers are most needed, enabling targeted marketing and distribution.

## Outcome
-**This analysis equips Air Pure Innovations with data-backed insights to design efficient, targeted, and adaptable air purifiers.
By aligning engineering decisions with environmental data, products can better address real-world air quality challenges.
